	<p>Among my qualities, planning and organizational skills are most definitely my strong points. Organization and leadership serve as my strengths – this will be an asset to any dynamic company. My skills as a leader include that I can set clear goals, but more importantly, execute whatever it takes to reach my set goals. I can delegate and assign tasks and responsibilities, implement decisions, manage finances and budgets, and provide growth and development.</p>
	<p>I am a very sincere and receptive person who always views everything with a positive attitude, ensuring that everything is executed and planned. I believe in and implement the following saying, "I plan my work and work my plan." I possess the ability to deliver quality work within the time limits set.</p>

	<h3 id="myPassion">My passions:</h3>
	<p>"A hundred years from now it will not matter what my bank account balance was, the sort of house I lived in, or the kind of car I drove ... but the world may be different because I was important in the life of one child "- Forest E. Wilcraft</p>
	<p>I try to be involved, as much as possible, in various charity organizations in the community. At every school, including during the practical periods, where I had the opportunity to be involved in community service, I did it without further hesitation. At Jan van Riebeeck Primary School, I was also involved at the Soyalise-community project, together with the mentioned “bread-and-tin cans” project, where we handed food parcels to less privilege  schools. I feel it's every person's responsibility to help with the improvement of less privilege communities, and more specifically schools as our leaders of tomorrow are taught in schools. </p>
	<p>I strive on new challenges and to stay as busy as possible with different projects throughout the year. I am a very hardworking individual, thus the aforementioned interested and involvement with a few projects will not affect my school work. Again, as one of my favorite quotes describe it:  "I plan my work and work my plan"</p>
	<p>I am an adventurous person that loves the nature and enjoy long hiking trails in the mountains. I have a great passion to involve the learners in nature and to emphasize its value in their upbringing and daily life.</p>
	<p>I maintain a good lifestyle with enough exercise as well as balanced eating habits and can therefore be seen as a good example of a healthy lifestyle. I will also motivate each learner in my class as much as possible to maintain a balanced lifestyle.</p>
